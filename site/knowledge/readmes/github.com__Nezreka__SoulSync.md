## What It Does

SoulSync bridges streaming services to your media server with automated discovery:

1. **Monitors artists** → Automatically detects new releases from your watchlist
2. **Generates playlists** → Release Radar, Discovery Weekly, Seasonal, Decade/Genre mixes, Cache-powered discovery
3. **Downloads missing tracks** → From Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, YouTube, or any combination via Hybrid mode
4. **Verifies downloads** → AcoustID fingerprinting for P2P sources (skipped for trusted API sources)
5. **Enriches metadata** → 9 enrichment workers (Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz)
6. **Tags consistently** → Picard-style MusicBrainz release preflight ensures all album tracks get the same release ID
7. **Organizes files** → Custom templates for clean folder structures
8. **Syncs media server** → Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome stay updated automatically
9. **Scrobbles plays** → Automatic scrobbling to Last.fm and ListenBrainz from your media server

**AcoustID Fingerprinting** (optional) — Verifies downloaded files match expected tracks
- Automatically skipped for trusted API sources (Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi)
- Only runs for P2P (Soulseek) and extracted audio (YouTube) where mislabeling is possible

**9 Background Enrichment Workers**: Spotify, MusicBrainz, iTunes, Deezer, AudioDB, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz
- Each worker independently processes artists, albums, and tracks
- Pause/resume controls on dashboard, auto-pause during database scans

- Fallback: iTunes/Apple Music or Deezer — configurable, no authentication required
- MusicBrainz enrichment with Picard-style album consistency

**Post-Processing Tag Embedding**
- Granular per-service tag toggles (18+ MusicBrainz tags, Spotify/iTunes/Deezer IDs, AudioDB mood/style, Tidal/Qobuz ISRCs, Last.fm tags, Genius URLs)
- Album art embedding, cover.jpg download
- Spotify rate limit protection across all API calls

### Advanced Matching Engine

- Version-aware matching: strictly rejects remixes when you want the original (and vice versa)
- Unicode and accent handling (KoЯn, Bjork, A$AP Rocky)
- Fuzzy matching with weighted confidence scoring (title, artist, duration)
- Album variation detection (Deluxe, Remastered, Taylor's Version, etc.)
- Streaming source results bypass filename-matching engine (API results trusted directly)

## Installation

### Docker (Recommended)

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
# Access at http://localhost:8008
```

### Unraid

SoulSync is available as an Unraid template. Install from Community Applications or manually add the template from:
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nezreka/SoulSync/main/templates/soulsync.xml
```

PUID/PGID are exposed in the template — set them to match your Unraid permissions (default: 99/100 for nobody/users).

### Python (No Docker)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nezreka/SoulSync
cd SoulSync
pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
python web_server.py
# Open http://localhost:8008
```

## Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- **slskd** running and accessible ([Download](https://github.com/slskd/slskd/releases)) — required for Soulseek downloads
- **Spotify API** credentials ([Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)) — optional but recommended for discovery
- **Media Server** (optional): Plex, Jellyfin, or Navidrome
- **Deezer ARL token** (optional): For Deezer downloads — get from browser cookies after logging into deezer.com
- **Tidal account** (optional): For Tidal downloads — authenticate via device flow in Settings
- **Qobuz account** (optional): For Qobuz downloads — email/password login in Settings

### Step 1: Set Up slskd

SoulSync talks to slskd through its API. See the [slskd setup guide](https://github.com/slskd/slskd) for API key configuration.

1. Add an API key in slskd's `settings.yml` under `web > authentication > api_keys`
2. Restart slskd
3. Paste the key into SoulSync's Settings → Downloads → Soulseek section

**Configure file sharing in slskd to avoid Soulseek bans.** Set up shared folders at `http://localhost:5030/shares`.

### Step 2: Set Up Spotify API (Optional)

Spotify gives you the best discovery features. Without it, SoulSync falls back to iTunes/Deezer for metadata.

1. Create an app at [developer.spotify.com/dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Add Redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback`
3. Copy Client ID and Client Secret into SoulSync Settings

More detail in [Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md](Support/DOCKER-OAUTH-FIX.md).

### Step 3: Configure SoulSync

Open SoulSync at `http://localhost:8008` and go to Settings.

**Download Source**: Choose your preferred source (Soulseek, Deezer, Tidal, Qobuz, HiFi, YouTube, or Hybrid)

**Paths**:
- **Download Path**: Container path to slskd's download folder (e.g., `/app/downloads`)
- **Transfer Path**: Where organized music goes (e.g., `/app/Transfer`)
- **Staging Path**: Optional import folder (e.g., `/app/Staging`)

**Media Server** (optional): Use your machine's actual IP (not `localhost` — that means inside the container)

### Step 4: Docker Path Mapping

| What | Container Path | Host Path |
|------|---------------|-----------|
| Config | `/app/config` | Your config folder |
| Logs | `/app/logs` | Your logs folder |
| Database | `/app/data` | Named volume (recommended) |
| Downloads | `/app/downloads` | Same folder slskd downloads to |
| Transfer | `/app/Transfer` | Where organized music goes |
| Staging | `/app/Staging` | Optional import folder |

**Important:** Use a named volume for the database (`soulsync_database:/app/data`). Direct host path mounts to `/app/data` can overwrite Python module files.
