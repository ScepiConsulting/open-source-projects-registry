YT Zero turns YouTube back into a simple reader for channels you chose on purpose. No Google account. No API key. No algorithmic home feed pushing videos you did not ask for.

It reads public YouTube RSS feeds, stores everything in your own SQLite or PostgreSQL database, and gives you a calm place to sort, schedule, watch, archive, and revisit videos from creators you already follow. With the optional [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) integration it can even download those videos and play them from disk, in its own player.

If the problem is "YouTube is good at surfacing more, not better," YT Zero is the opposite: a quiet inbox, your own rules, and a player built around intentional watching.

## Why it exists

YouTube is excellent at keeping attention and bad at staying out of the way. If all you want is:

- your subscriptions in one place
- a clean watch queue
- no forced sign-in
- no API setup
- no recommendation loop

then the default YouTube experience keeps adding noise around the thing you actually came for.

YT Zero removes that layer. It keeps subscriptions, watch progress, playlists, tags, and playback controls. It drops the account dependency and the recommendation machinery.

## What makes it useful

- **Focused inbox** — all new videos from followed channels in one chronological feed.
- **No Google dependency** — works without a Google account or YouTube Data API key.
- **Local-first state** — subscriptions, progress, history, playlists, tags, and rules are stored in your own SQLite or PostgreSQL database.
- **Built for triage** — schedule videos for later, archive the ones you will not watch, and come back on your terms.
- **Organized watching** — use tags, inherited channel tags, rules, and local playlists to shape your own feed.
- **Real playback controls** — theater view, captions, quality, display settings, and optional SponsorBlock support.
- **Downloads & local playback** — the optional yt-dlp plugin fetches videos to disk and plays them in YT Zero's own player: instant seeking, no embeds, no buffering, works offline.
- **Works for households** — profiles, authentication modes, child profiles with watch-time limits, and child lock make one install usable by more than one person.
- **Pulse** — understand actual viewing time by profile, channel, tag, hour, weekday, and content type without sending analytics outside your server.

## Features

- **Subscription inbox** — all new videos from followed channels in one feed.
- **Channel import** — add channels manually, import OPML, or import `subscriptions.csv` from Google Takeout.
- **Live and upcoming streams** — dedicated live view with automatic status refresh, plus a per-profile option to keep live and Upcoming entries out of the main feed.
- **Watch later buckets** — schedule videos for Today, Tonight, Tomorrow, Tomorrow evening, or Weekend.
- **Archive flow** — reject videos, restore them later, and keep the main feed clean.
- **History and progress** — record watched videos and resume partially watched ones.
- **Incognito mode** — stop history, progress, and viewing-insight writes for the current browser tab.
- **Tags & rules** — tag videos and channels, inherit channel tags to videos, and automate sorting with rules.
- **User playlists** — local playlists with icons, manual additions, and rules.
- **Profiles** — multiple isolated profiles on one install, each with its own state.
- **Pulse** — an optional, default-hidden sidebar view with combined and per-profile viewing patterns, favorite channels and tags, activity hours, content mix, and time saved by SponsorBlock.
- **Authentication** — none, shared login, per-profile login, OIDC, or proxy headers, with password and passkey support. Per-profile logins derive from profile names; an administrator can generate or reset a one-time temporary password for one profile at a time, and each profile can replace it after signing in.
- **Child lock** — PIN-protect household settings while leaving each profile's own tags and playlists editable.
- **Child profiles** — daily watch-time limits, parent-approved extensions, subscribed-content-only mode, optional Shorts/live blocking, downloaded-videos-only mode, reduced settings access, and a parent activity panel with immediate stop/unlock controls.
- **Downloads (yt-dlp)** — an optional plugin for scheduled, manual, playlist-wide, and rule-based downloads. It plays local files in a built-in player, supports metadata and subtitle sidecars, shows live progress, and cleans up with retention rules and a storage cap.
- **Shorts tab & player** — a followed-channels-only vertical Shorts feed with format-native cards and a full-screen swipe player.
- **SponsorBlock** — optionally skip sponsored segments, intros, outros, and more.
- **DeArrow** — optionally replace clickbait titles and thumbnails with community-created alternatives from the [DeArrow project](https://dearrow.ajay.app/). Hover or focus a video card to reveal the control that switches between the DeArrow and original versions; library metadata stays intact.
- **Comments and list continuation** — optionally load comments on demand and continue through whichever list opened the player, automatically or after confirmation.
- **Playback and display controls** — theater view, captions, quality, display customization, and optional auto-fullscreen when a phone rotates to landscape.
- **Internationalization** — English, Polish, and German UI.

See the full list with screens in the **[Features](https://github.com/Pelski/ytzero/wiki/Features)** wiki page.

## Downloads & offline playback (yt-dlp)

The **YT-DLP Integration** plugin (disabled by default) uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) to keep local copies of the videos you actually plan to watch — and plays them in YT Zero's own player instead of the YouTube embed:

- **Automatic downloads** — videos you schedule for later are fetched ahead of time; optionally every fresh upload from followed channels.
- **Watch your way** — when a video isn't downloaded yet, choose: play from YouTube now, or wait for a priority download and watch locally. Either can be the default.
- **A real player** — instant seeking, chapter and SponsorBlock markers on the seek bar, keyboard shortcuts, picture-in-picture, Media Session — with the same progress tracking as the embedded player.
- **Smart retention** — keep files for N days, drop them after watching, protect liked and pinned videos, and cap total disk usage. Everything is cleaned up automatically.
- **Household-aware** — one download serves every profile, and child profiles can be limited to downloaded videos only.

The Docker image bundles yt-dlp and ffmpeg and keeps yt-dlp updated daily. Details and the full settings reference: **[YT-DLP Integration](https://github.com/Pelski/ytzero/wiki/YT-DLP-Integration)**.

## How it works

YT Zero does not scrape your account or sync with YouTube through a private API. It watches public channel feeds, fetches the metadata needed to build your local library, and serves that library back as a quieter interface. With the yt-dlp plugin enabled, it additionally downloads the video files themselves — everything else stays the same.

That means:

- easy self-hosting
- no API quota headaches
- local ownership of your app state
- a product that stays narrow on purpose

## Quick start

YT Zero can run as a regular Docker container, an Unraid Community App, a
native systemd service, or in its own Proxmox LXC:

| Method | Best for | How it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Docker Compose | Most servers and NAS systems | Published multi-architecture GHCR image |
| Unraid | Unraid users who prefer DockerMan / Community Apps | The same GHCR image with persistent appdata |
| Proxmox VE | Homelabs managed from a PVE host | Unprivileged Debian LXC, without Docker inside |
| Debian / Ubuntu | LXC, VM or bare-metal Linux | Native Bun application managed by systemd |

### Docker

Run with the published GHCR image:

```yaml
services:
  ytzero:
    image: ghcr.io/pelski/ytzero:latest
    container_name: ytzero
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Unraid

YT Zero is available in Community Applications:
**[YT-Zero on Unraid Community Apps](https://ca.unraid.net/apps/yt-zero-1ry69q20pcrx1i?q=YT-Zero)**.
Open **Apps**, search for **YT-Zero**, install, review the
`/mnt/user/appdata/ytzero` data path and port `3001`, then apply it.

Alternatively, load the bundled template manually from an Unraid terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pelski/ytzero/main/templates/ytzero.xml \
  -o /boot/config/plugins/dockerMan/templates-user/my-ytzero.xml
```

then reload **Docker → Add Container** and select the `ytzero` template.

### Proxmox VE

On the Proxmox host — creates an unprivileged Debian LXC and installs YT Zero natively inside it:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pelski/ytzero/main/scripts/proxmox-lxc.sh)"
```

### Debian / Ubuntu (LXC, VM, bare metal)

As root — installs Bun, ffmpeg and yt-dlp, and runs YT Zero as a systemd service. Re-run it to update:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pelski/ytzero/main/scripts/install.sh)"
```

Open <http://localhost:3001>. The app starts empty — add channels from **Settings → Channels**.

Full instructions (Proxmox and installer options, Unraid, local development, production-like start) are in **[Installation](https://github.com/Pelski/ytzero/wiki/Installation)**.

The native and Proxmox commands require a release that includes the packaged
`ytzero-vX.Y.Z.tar.gz` asset. Older tags without that asset are Docker/local
only.

## Browser extensions

For the best browser experience, use **[YT Zero Enhance](https://github.com/Pelski/ytzero-enhance)**, the recommended companion extension for YT Zero. It connects to your self-hosted instance, redirects supported links, enhances the embedded player with YT Zero-style controls and profile settings, and adds reliable keyboard shortcuts, chapters, SponsorBlock segments, picture-in-picture, fullscreen, theatre mode, and frame capture. It supports Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and Safari; see its repository for current installation options.

If you only want automatic redirects, [YTZero Redirect](https://github.com/pekempy/YTZero-Redirect) is a lightweight Firefox and Chrome extension by [@pekempy](https://github.com/pekempy). Set your YT Zero address once, then YouTube video, Shorts, playlist, channel, and handle URLs automatically open on your self-hosted YT Zero instance — with no telemetry or data collection.

## Tech stack

| Layer | Stack |
| --- | --- |
| Backend | Bun, Hono |
| Frontend | React, Vite, TypeScript |
| Storage | SQLite by default, PostgreSQL optional |
| Downloads | [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) + ffmpeg (optional plugin, bundled in Docker) |
| Runtime | Docker/Unraid, a Proxmox LXC or Debian/Ubuntu host via systemd, or local Bun |

## Privacy & license

YT Zero does not require a Google account or a YouTube Data API key, and stores app data in your own SQLite or PostgreSQL database. It still connects to YouTube to fetch RSS feeds, metadata, thumbnails, pages, and embedded videos. With the YT-DLP Integration plugin enabled it also downloads video files from YouTube via yt-dlp; those files are stored locally and removed by the plugin's retention rules.

The optional [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app/) integration fetches community-created replacement titles and thumbnails from DeArrow/SponsorBlock services. It is disabled by default, never overwrites metadata stored in the local library, and can be enabled separately for titles and thumbnails. Replacement-title lookups send the first four characters of the video's SHA-256 hash; thumbnail requests include the YouTube video ID. Branding lookup results are cached in memory for 15 minutes, and failures fall back to the original title and thumbnail. DeArrow/SponsorBlock data is provided under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.
