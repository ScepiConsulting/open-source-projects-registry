# QuickDrop

Self-hosted file sharing, pastebin and URL shortener. Upload files or paste text, protect them with per-item passwords,
hand out expiring share links, and administer everything from a web admin panel that applies changes without a restart.

## Features

### File uploads

- Chunked uploads — the browser splits files into 4 MB chunks and the server merges them in the background, so large
  uploads survive flaky connections.
- Folder and multi-file uploads — a picked directory, or several files selected at once, is zipped in the browser
  (ZIP64, stored uncompressed) with a JSON manifest of the original paths and sizes. One upload, one download, and the
  contents are listed as a tree on the file page, the file list and the share link. A selection that shares a single
  top-level directory keeps that directory's name (`docs.zip`); anything else is a dated bundle, `files-2692-atbn.zip`
  for 2 September 2026 — the four-character code is added by the server so two bundles from the same day never
  present the same name.
- Archive limits: at most 1000 files per selection, and the browser hands over to a streaming
  ZIP64 writer above 256 MB rather than holding the whole archive in memory. Contents trees
  longer than 500 lines are collapsed behind a "show more" on the file page.
- Configurable maximum file size and default retention period; users can renew a file to reset its deletion date.
- `Keep indefinitely` exempts a file from scheduled deletion. `Hide from list` keeps it off the public file list. Either
  toggle can be restricted to admins.
- Optional client-side EXIF/metadata stripping for images before upload (files up to 25 MB).

### Encryption and passwords

- Files uploaded with a password are encrypted at rest with AES-256/GCM in 4 MB chunks, keyed by PBKDF2. Files encrypted
  by older versions (monolithic GCM, and AES-256/CBC from 1.x) are still readable.
- Per-file passwords are BCrypt-hashed; a successful unlock issues a session token scoped to that file and browser
  session.
- Encryption and upload passwords can each be turned off site-wide.

### Pastebin

- Plain-text or Markdown pastes with syntax highlighting in both the editor and the viewer.
- Password-protected pastes use the same encryption and session flow as files.
- Edit-only mode — anyone can read the paste, only the password holder can change it.
- Immutable flag — locks the content permanently.
- Per-paste view counts and a history log.
- Pastes are capped at 10 MB, or the configured max file size, whichever is smaller.

### File previews

- Images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, SVG), plain text and code, PDF, JSON, and CSV/TSV.
- SVGs are transcoded to PNG server-side with Apache Batik; script execution and external resource loading are disabled
  during transcoding.
- Previews above a configurable size require a manual click instead of auto-loading.

### Share links

- Generate a share URL for a file without revealing its password.
- Optional expiry date and download-count cap; expired and exhausted tokens are cleaned up on a schedule.
- Simplified mode issues unlimited, non-expiring links with a shorter URL.
- Every share link has a QR code (SVG and PNG).
- When nothing gates a file — no per-file password and no app password — the share panel offers the page link and a QR
  code directly instead of the limiter form.
- For encrypted files, a one-time share key is generated and the file is re-encrypted under it in the background. The
  key travels in the URL; only its BCrypt hash is stored. Recipients see a
  "being prepared" page while that runs.
- Creation, download, expiry and revocation are all recorded in the file's history.

### Link shortener

A general-purpose URL shortener at `/link/new`, sharing the short-code table with share links.

- Shorten any URL into a `/s/{code}` link with a QR code; no file involved.
- Custom aliases — request a specific code instead of a random one. Admin-only by default.
- Optional expiry date and use-count cap.
- Destinations are validated on creation and re-validated on every visit: `http`/`https` only, and never loopback,
  link-local or private-network addresses. Admins can add a domain allowlist or blocklist.
- Optional threat-intelligence checks against Phishing Army, URLhaus and Google Safe Browsing. All three ship disabled
  and each requires the admin to accept its licence terms in the settings UI first. Safe Browsing only ever receives a
  truncated hash of the destination.
- Interstitial preview page showing the destination before continuing — always, never, or non-admins only (default).
- Per-visit logging can be switched off independently of the link's own use counters.

### Storage backends

Files can be stored somewhere other than the server's disk. The backend is chosen in the admin settings and applies
without a restart.

| Backend              | Configuration                                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Local disk (default) | File storage path                                                        |
| S3                   | Endpoint, bucket, region, access/secret key, path-style flag, key prefix |
| Azure Blob Storage   | Connection string, container, key prefix                                 |
| SFTP                 | Host, port, username, password or private key, base path, known-hosts    |
| WebDAV               | URL, username, password, key prefix                                      |

- Test connection verifies credentials before you commit to a backend.
- The migration tool at `/admin/storage-migration` moves existing files between backends, with a preflight check first.
- Backend health is polled; the UI shows a banner when it is unreachable, and notifications can fire when it goes down
  and comes back.

### Database backups

- Scheduled backups on a cron expression, keeping the newest N. Off by default.
- On-demand backup regardless of the schedule.
- Upload a backup file from elsewhere, so restoring is not limited to backups this instance made.
- Backups are plain SQLite files produced with `VACUUM INTO`, so one can be copied over
  `db/quickdrop.db` by hand if the app will not start.
- Download a backup off the server.
- Every candidate is validated with `PRAGMA quick_check` before it is allowed to replace the live database.
- Restoring from the UI stages the file and restarts the app; the restore is applied at boot.
- Backups, uploads, restores and failures are all logged to the activity log.

### Activity log

- Every file, paste, share, short-link, admin and system event is recorded with timestamp, IP address and user agent.
- Filterable by date range, event type, IP, user agent and source type.
- Export the current filter to CSV from the Activity page.
- Optional retention sweep — per-category age limits (files, pastes, shares, short links, admin, system; 365 days each
  by default) on a cron schedule. Rows are written to a CSV archive on the configured storage backend under
  `activity-archive/` and only deleted once that archive is committed. Archives are never pruned. Off by default.

### Notifications

- Discord webhook and SMTP email, with per-event toggles for uploads, downloads, renewals, deletions, share creation and
  download, paste create/view/edit, and storage up/down.
- Noisy events (share-link downloads, paste views) default to off.
- Optional batching into a digest at a configurable interval.
- Test buttons send a live notification from the settings page.

### Security

- Optional site-wide application password.
- Separate BCrypt-verified admin password, set through a first-run setup flow.
- Rate limiting: 10 requests per 60-second window per client address on the file-password, admin-password, share,
  share-download, link-creation and `/s/{code}` endpoints; over the limit returns HTTP 429 with `Retry-After: 60`.
- Cookie-based CSRF protection on state-changing requests; session cookies are `HttpOnly` and
  `SameSite=Strict`. Both cookies get the `Secure` flag when behind a reverse proxy — see
  [Running behind a reverse proxy](#running-behind-a-reverse-proxy).
- Configurable session timeout; admin and file sessions are tracked and bounded in memory.
- Outbound URLs (Discord webhook, remote storage backends, short-link destinations) are blocked from resolving to
  internal network addresses.
- `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` are honoured for client-IP resolution only when the trusted-proxy setting is on.

### Branding and feature switches

- Custom application name and logo.
- Choose which page `/` lands on: upload, file list, or new paste.
- Independently enable or disable uploads, the file list page, the pastebin, share links, the link shortener,
  encryption, upload passwords, previews and the admin dashboard button. Uploads and the shortener can be made
  admin-only. Admins keep access to disabled features; other visitors get a service-unavailable page.

## Installation

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quickdrop \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -v /path/to/db:/app/db \
  -v /path/to/files:/app/files \
  -v /path/to/log:/app/log \
  roastslav/quickdrop:latest
```

Open <http://localhost:8080> and follow the admin setup prompt to set the admin password.

The container runs the app as an unprivileged `quickdrop` user, not root. `PUID`/`PGID` (default
`1000`/`1000`) set that user's UID/GID; set them to match whoever owns `/path/to/db`, `/path/to/files`
and `/path/to/log` on the host if that isn't `1000:1000` — the entrypoint fixes ownership of those
three directories to match on every start, so a mismatch only costs one extra `chown` on the next
boot rather than breaking startup.

### Docker Compose

The repository ships a `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Running behind a reverse proxy

QuickDrop's session and CSRF cookies only get their `Secure` flag automatically when the request
QuickDrop itself sees is HTTPS. A TLS-terminating reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik, ...) talks
plain HTTP to the app behind it, so without one of the two opt-ins below, both cookies are sent
without `Secure` even though the real, external connection is HTTPS.

**Option 1 — trust the proxy's `X-Forwarded-Proto` header (recommended).** Turn on **Trust reverse
proxy headers** in Admin → Settings (`quickdrop.trustedProxyEnabled`, off by default) — the same
setting that already governs trusting `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` for client-IP logging and rate
limiting. With it on, QuickDrop marks both cookies `Secure` whenever a request carries
`X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, and does nothing otherwise — so your proxy must actually set that
header. Example config:

```nginx
# nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
}
```

```caddyfile
# Caddyfile
example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080 {
        header_up X-Forwarded-Proto {scheme}
        header_up X-Forwarded-For {remote_host}
    }
}
```

Caddy sets `X-Forwarded-Proto`/`X-Forwarded-For` automatically for `reverse_proxy`; the
`header_up` lines above are shown for clarity, not strictly required.

**Option 2 — force it unconditionally.** If your proxy doesn't (or can't) send
`X-Forwarded-Proto`, turn on **Force cookies to Secure** in Admin → Settings
(`quickdrop.forceSecureCookiesEnabled`, off by default, next to Option 1's toggle) instead. This
forces both cookies `Secure` on every response, regardless of what any request header says or
whether Trust reverse proxy headers is on, and takes effect immediately — no restart. For
deployments that prefer env-var-managed config over a DB-stored toggle, setting
`SERVER_SERVLET_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` (or `server.servlet.session.cookie.secure=true`) as a
startup property has the same effect.

> [!WARNING]
> Never expose the app's own port (`8080` by default) directly to the internet, or otherwise let
> it be reached by anything other than your reverse proxy, while either option is enabled. With
> option 1, a caller connecting directly could send a fake `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` over plain
> HTTP and have QuickDrop treat the connection as secure when it isn't. With option 2, a direct
> plain-HTTP caller simply can't use the app at all — the browser silently drops `Secure` cookies
> sent over HTTP, breaking login and CSRF-protected requests. Bind the app to `127.0.0.1` or a
> private network, or firewall the port, so the proxy is the only path in.

Neither option is needed, and both default to off, for a plain-HTTP local install — cookies
behave exactly as before.

### Build and run manually

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoastSlav/quickdrop.git
```

```bash
./mvnw -B clean package
```

```bash
java -jar target/quickdrop.jar
```

The app listens on port 8080. The database, files and logs are created relative to the working directory you launch
from — see [Data directories](#data-directories).

## ☁️ One-Click Deploy

[![Deploy on RepoCloud](https://d16t0pc4846x52.cloudfront.net/deploylobe.svg)](https://repocloud.io/details/QuickDrop/)

---

## Configuration

Configuration is split in two. A small set of startup properties lives in
`src/main/resources/application.properties` and is fixed once the app starts; everything else is a runtime setting
managed from the admin panel and applied immediately.

### Startup properties

Override any of these with a JVM argument (`-Dserver.port=9000`), a command-line argument (`--server.port=9000`), or the
equivalent environment variable using Spring Boot's relaxed binding (`SERVER_PORT=9000`).

| Property                                  | Default                                                          | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The published image sets no application-specific environment variables of its own. `PUID`/`PGID` are
the exception — they're consumed by the container's entrypoint script, not the Spring application, to
pick the UID/GID the process runs as; see [Docker](#docker).

### Data directories

All paths are relative to the process working directory (`/app` in the image).

| Path                | Contents                                                                                                                | Declared as a Docker volume |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `db/`               | SQLite database `quickdrop.db`, plus `backups/` (database backups) and `branding/` (custom logo)                                                                                          | Yes                         |
| `files/`            | `reputation-feeds/` (cached Phishing Army and URLhaus feeds), plus — when the storage backend is Local disk — the uploaded files themselves and `.upload-chunks/` staging during chunked uploads | Yes                         |
| `log/`              | `quickdrop.log`. Relocatable via the **Log storage path** runtime setting, which takes effect on the next restart       | Yes                         |

The `db/`, `files/` and `log/` mounts are unchanged. Up to v1.5.3 the custom logo lived in a
top-level `branding/` directory; anything still there is moved into `db/branding/` on startup,
so that mount can be dropped.

### Runtime settings

Managed at `/admin/settings`, stored in the database, applied without a restart — the one exception is **Log storage
path**, which the logging system reads before the database is open and so only picks up on the next restart. Grouped as
they appear in the settings tabs.

## Usage

**Upload a file.** Go to `/file/upload`, drag in a file, several files, or a folder — or use the buttons to pick them —
optionally set a password and a description, and upload. You get a file page at `/file/{uuid}` with the download link,
the deletion date, and a renew button. Anything but a single file arrives as one zip, with its contents listed on the
file page.

**Create a paste.** Go to `/file/paste/new`, pick plain text or Markdown, optionally set a password, edit-only mode or
the immutable flag, and save.

**Share something.** On a file or paste page, open the share panel. If the item is gated by a password, you get a share
link with an optional expiry date and download cap. If nothing gates it, you get the page link and a QR code instead.

**Shorten a URL.** Go to `/link/new`, paste a URL, optionally request a custom alias, an expiry date or a use cap. You
get a `/s/{code}` link and a QR code.

**Retrieve something.** Open the link. Password-protected items prompt for the password; share links carry their own key
and do not.

Key routes:

## Admin panel

Reachable at `/admin`, protected by its own password. On first run, `/admin/setup` prompts you to set it; once set, the
setup endpoint refuses to overwrite it.

| Page              | Route                      | What it does                                                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dashboard         | `/admin/dashboard`         | Aggregate stats: downloads, storage used, average file size, paste counts and views |
| Files             | `/admin/files`             | Paginated, searchable list with delete, hide, extend and keep-indefinitely actions  |
| Pastes            | `/admin/pastes`            | The same for pastes, with per-paste view counts and history                         |
| Links             | `/admin/links`             | Share links and redirect links, with expiry, remaining uses and a revoke button     |
| Activity          | `/admin/activity`          | Event log filterable by date, type, IP, user agent and source; CSV export           |
| Backups           | `/admin/backups`           | Create, upload, download, restore and delete database backups                       |
| Storage migration | `/admin/storage-migration` | Move files between storage backends, with a preflight check                         |
| Settings          | `/admin/settings`          | All runtime settings                                                                |

Settings are organised into seven tabs: Appearance, Features, Files, Security, Notifications, Storage and About.
Sections with five or more rows collapse by default.

Each file and paste also has a history page listing every event — upload, download, share-link download, renewal,
deletion, share creation, expiry and revocation — with timestamp, IP address and user agent.

## Internationalization

Eight languages, selectable per session from the language picker in the navigation bar. The admin sets the default for
new visitors.

| Code | Language             | Bundle                   |
|------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `en` | English              | `messages.properties`    |
| `de` | German               | `messages_de.properties` |
| `es` | Spanish              | `messages_es.properties` |
| `fr` | French               | `messages_fr.properties` |
| `it` | Italian              | `messages_it.properties` |
| `bg` | Bulgarian            | `messages_bg.properties` |
| `ja` | Japanese             | `messages_ja.properties` |
| `zh` | Chinese (Simplified) | `messages_zh.properties` |

## Updating

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

For a plain `docker run` deployment, stop and remove the container, pull, and start it again with the same volume
mounts:

```bash
docker stop quickdrop && docker rm quickdrop && docker pull roastslav/quickdrop:latest
```

Flyway runs the database migrations at startup. Check the release notes for the version you are moving to before
upgrading — some releases need a configuration change as well.

---

## Development

```bash
./mvnw -B clean verify
```

```bash
./mvnw -B clean package
```

```bash
npm install && npm run tw:build
```

`verify` runs the test suite and enforces a 70% JaCoCo line-coverage gate. `tw:build` regenerates
`static/css/tailwind.css` from `tailwind-input.css`.

The running app serves resources from `target/classes`, so an edit under
`src/main/resources/static` only reaches the browser after a build or:

```bash
./mvnw process-resources
```

Images are published by Jenkins: `:develop` from the `dev` branch on every build, and `:latest`
plus `:v{version}` from `master` when the `pom.xml` version changes. Both are multi-arch (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`).

| Tag        | Source                                                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `:latest`  | Latest release from `master`                                              |
| `:v2.0.0`  | Specific release                                                          |
| `:develop` | Latest `dev` build — may include incomplete features and breaking changes |
