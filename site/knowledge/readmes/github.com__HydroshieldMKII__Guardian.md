### Unraid

**Prerequisites**

- Unraid server
- Compose Manager plugin installed

**Installation Steps**

1. Navigate to **Docker → Compose**
2. Create a new stack
3. Paste the contents of `docker-compose.example.yml`
4. Customize volumes and ports (optional):

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - /mnt/user/appdata/guardian:/app/data

   ports:
     - "3456:3000"
   ```

5. Deploy with **Compose Up**
6. Access at `http://[UNRAID-IP]:3456`

---

## Configuration

Guardian can be configured through environment variables or the web interface.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file to customize deployment settings:

| Variable                  | Description          | Default  | Applies To              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ----------------------- |
| `PLEXGUARD_FRONTEND_PORT` | Web interface port   | `3000`   | Docker, Proxmox, Unraid |
| `VERSION`                 | Docker image version | `latest` | Docker, Unraid          |

**Example `.env` file:**

```bash
PLEXGUARD_FRONTEND_PORT=3456
VERSION=v1.2.3
```

### File Locations

- **Docker**: Place `.env` in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml`
- **Proxmox**: Place `.env` at `/opt/guardian/.env` inside the LXC

### Applying Changes

**Docker:**

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

**Proxmox:**

```bash
systemctl restart guardian-backend guardian-frontend
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most configuration is done through Guardian's web interface. Environment variables are primarily for deployment customization.

---

## Updating

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Always backup your database before updating (Settings → Admin Tools → Export Database).

**Manual Update:**

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### Password Recovery

If you've lost access to your admin account, you can reset credentials from the command line.

#### Docker

All commands are run next to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

**List all admin users:**

```bash
docker compose exec backend node src/scripts/list-admins.js
```

**Reset admin password:**

```bash
docker compose exec backend node src/scripts/update-admin.js "USERNAME_HERE" "NEW_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

Replace `USERNAME_HERE` with your admin username and `NEW_PASSWORD_HERE` with your desired password.

#### Proxmox (LXC)

All commands are run from inside the LXC container.

**List all admin users:**

```bash
node /opt/guardian/backend/src/scripts/list-admins.js
```

**Reset admin password:**

```bash
node /opt/guardian/backend/src/scripts/update-admin.js "USERNAME_HERE" "NEW_PASSWORD_HERE"
```

Replace `USERNAME_HERE` with your admin username and `NEW_PASSWORD_HERE` with your desired password.

### Disable Captcha

If you are locked out due to captcha issues, you can disable Cloudflare Turnstile captcha via the command line. Running the command will immediately disable captcha by clearing the Turnstile site and secret keys.

#### Docker

All commands are run next to the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```bash
docker compose exec backend node src/scripts/disable-captcha.js
```

#### Proxmox (LXC)

All commands are run from inside the LXC container.

```bash
node /opt/guardian/backend/src/scripts/disable-captcha.js
