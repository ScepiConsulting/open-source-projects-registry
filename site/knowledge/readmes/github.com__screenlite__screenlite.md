# Screenlite
Screenlite is an open-source digital signage solution, providing an alternative to costly proprietary software.

Get in early, use it now, and help shape what comes next. Your feedback, insights, and contributions will directly influence the future of Screenlite. Together, we’ll create a solution that’s simple, powerful, and truly free.

## ⚠️ **Development notes:**  

Screenlite is currently **in public development** and **not ready for production use**. It’s not feature-complete yet.

**The client-side experience is partially broken** — you can explore the interface, but expect bugs, errors, and incomplete features.

Database migrations may not be incremental at this stage. Sometimes migrations will be cleared and recreated, requiring you to reset your database to run newer versions of the app.

## How it works?

Screenlite consists of two main components:
- **Screenlite CMS**: The backend that manages content, schedules, and devices.
- **Screenlite Player**: The client app that displays content on screens.

This repository contains the Screenlite CMS, which is the core of the system. It provides a web interface for managing your digital signage content and devices.

It is centralized, meaning you can manage all your screens from a single place.
