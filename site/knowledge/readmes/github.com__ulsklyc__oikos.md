Oikos is a self-hosted web app for families who want to organize their everyday life in one place — without cloud accounts, subscriptions, or data leaving the house. It runs as a Docker container on any home server or NAS, is accessible from every device in the household, and can be installed as a PWA on phones and tablets.

The goal is a single, private place for everything that keeps a household running: shared tasks, grocery lists, meal plans, a family calendar, budgets, and more. Each module is independent — use what fits, ignore what doesn't.

## Features

| Module | Description |
|---|---|
| **Tasks** | Shared tasks with deadlines, priorities, subtasks, and recurring schedules. Kanban board with touch-friendly one-tap status buttons. Archive completed tasks to keep lists clean. Inline reminder presets (15 min to 2 weeks before due). |
| **Shopping Lists** | Collaborative lists organized by aisle. Import ingredients from meal plans in one click. |
| **Meal Planning** | Weekly drag-and-drop planner. Export ingredient lists directly to your shopping list. |
| **Recipes** | Create, duplicate, and scale reusable recipes. Pre-fill meal slots from a recipe or save any meal as a recipe. |
| **Calendar** | Two-way sync with Google Calendar (OAuth) and Apple iCloud (CalDAV). Subscribe to any public ICS/webcal URL with per-subscription color and visibility. Overlapping timed events render side-by-side. Events support file attachments (images, PDFs, Office documents). |
| **Documents** | Upload and manage family files (PDF, images, Office documents up to 5 MB). Grid/list view, drag-and-drop upload, 14 category tags (medical, school, identity, finance, and more), per-document visibility (family, selected members, private), archive and download. |
| **Budget** | Track income and expenses with recurring entries, monthly trends, and CSV export. 35 predefined categories plus custom ones. Supports 15 currencies. Loans tab for instalment-based loan tracking with per-payment history and automatic paid-off detection. |
| **Notes & Contacts** | Colored sticky notes with Markdown support. Contact directory with vCard import/export. |
| **Birthdays** | Birthday tracker with automatic annual calendar events, age display, profile photos, and 1-day-before reminders. |
| **Reminders** | Time-based reminders on tasks and calendar events. In-app notification badge. |
| **Family** | Assign family roles, profile pictures, phone, email, and birthday per member. Family details are automatically synced to Contacts and Birthdays. |
| **API Tokens** | Named Bearer / X-API-Key tokens for external integrations. SHA-256-hashed at rest, with optional expiry. OpenAPI 3.0 spec at `/api/v1/openapi.json`. |
| **Backup** | Admin-only database backup and restore via the Settings UI. Download a snapshot or restore from a file upload with an automatic pre-restore rollback copy. |

## Design & Technology

- **Liquid Glass UI** — translucent surfaces, backdrop blur, module-tinted overlays, spring animations — inspired by Apple's Liquid Glass, built in pure CSS
- **PWA** — installable on any device, works offline, dark mode, responsive from phone to desktop
- **Privacy First** — SQLCipher AES-256 encrypted database, fully self-hosted, zero telemetry
- **Zero Build Step** — pure ES modules, no bundler, no transpiler, no framework
- **Multilingual** — 15 languages with automatic locale detection (de, en, es, fr, it, sv, el, ru, tr, zh, ja, ar, hi, pt, uk)

## Quick Start

**Option A — Web Installer (recommended)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos.git && cd oikos
node tools/installer/install-server.js
```

Open **http://localhost:8090** in your browser. The wizard configures your `.env`, starts Docker, and creates your admin account. Requires Node.js 18+ on the host.

**Option B — Pre-built image (no clone required)**

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulsklyc/oikos/main/docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ulsklyc/oikos/main/.env.example
cp .env.example .env          # set SESSION_SECRET and DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec oikos node setup.js
```

**Option C — Build from source**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulsklyc/oikos.git && cd oikos
cp .env.example .env          # set SESSION_SECRET and DB_ENCRYPTION_KEY
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec oikos node setup.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and sign in with the admin credentials you created above.
