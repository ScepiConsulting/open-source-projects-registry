## Important Migration Notice

Secret-file/Credential-Manager support is currently `opt-in` only to give existing users time to prepare.

This is a transition period, not a permanent default.

In releases approaching `1.0`, this behavior will be flipped to `opt-out` (secure secret resolution enabled by default).

Sortarr is a read-only analytics and organisation tool for Sonarr and Radarr libraries. It helps you identify missing media, mismatches, and optimisation opportunities using real playback data from providers like Tautulli, Jellystat, or Plex.

Sortarr provides a data-driven management layer for your media library, using optional playback behaviour data to help you to optimise your library.

Sortarr does not modify, move, or rename your media. It can analyse Sonarr and Radarr libraries, or use Plex directly as a media source, and incorporates playback and history data to present actionable insights.

---

## Key capabilities

* Analyse Sonarr and Radarr libraries in a unified interface
* Integrate playback history from Tautulli, Jellystat, or Plex
* Identify missing media, mismatches, and optimisation opportunities
* Support multiple Sonarr and Radarr instances
* Highlight duplicate titles across instances and filter them quickly
* Support global quick text filtering across row data (for example `aac`)
* Fully read-only operation for safety

---

## Who this is for

Sortarr is designed for users who:

* Use Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Tautulli, or Jellystat
* Want data-driven insight into their library
* Manage medium to large collections

## Quick start

Supports Docker, Unraid, Linux, Windows, and NAS environments.

### Docker


Create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  sortarr:
    image: ghcr.io/jaredharper1/sortarr:latest
    container_name: sortarr
    ports:
      - "9595:8787"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start Sortarr:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Access the web interface:

```
http://localhost:9595
```

---

### Unraid

Sortarr can be installed on Unraid using the included template file.

### Install using the provided template:

1. Open the Unraid web interface

2. Go to the Docker tab

3. Click Add Container

4. Switch to Advanced View

5. Open the template dropdown and select User Templates

6. Import or paste the contents of [docs/unraid-template.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr/refs/heads/main/docs/unraid-template.xml)

8. Configure the /config path to a persistent appdata location (recommended: /mnt/user/appdata/sortarr)

9. Apply and start the container

Access the web interface:

```
http://<unraid-ip>:9595
```

Your configuration will persist in the configured appdata directory.

Community Applications support is coming soon.

Detailed Unraid configuration coming to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Jaredharper1/Sortarr/wiki) soon.

---
## Initial setup

When you first open Sortarr, for an ideal setup:

1. Add your Sonarr and/or Radarr instances
2. Add at least one history provider (Tautulli, Jellystat, or Plex)
3. Add one playback provider (current only Plex is supported, with Jellyfin and Emby support coming soon!)
4. Test connections, then Save configuration.

Sortarr will begin analysing your libraries immediately, and display a PowerBI like spreadsheet with helpful tools to help you spot outliers and issues.

## NOTE

### Reverse proxy / HTTPS (Traefik, Nginx, Cloudflare, etc.)

Sortarr can be run behind a reverse proxy. In that case it may need to trust X-Forwarded-* headers so Flask correctly detects the external scheme/host (for example https://sortarr.mydomain.com). 

If this is not set correctly, you may see errors like "CSRF origin mismatch" during setup when accessing Sortarr via HTTPS through a proxy.

```
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS (optional)
```
Typical values:
```
0 Disabled
1 Single proxy (default)
2 Double proxy (e.g., Cloudflare Tunnel → Traefik → Sortarr)
```
By default, `SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS` trusts that many `X-Forwarded-For` entries, while `X-Forwarded-Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-Port`, and `X-Forwarded-Prefix` default to trusting a single forwarded value when proxy mode is enabled. This matches common proxy chains where only `X-Forwarded-For` grows per hop.

As of `0.8.2.1`, these settings are loaded from the config file before `ProxyFix` initializes, so values defined in `.env` / your mounted config are honored on startup.

If your proxies emit a different number of values per header, override them individually:
```
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS_FOR=2
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS_HOST=1
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS_PROTO=1
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS_PORT=1
SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS_PREFIX=0
```

For example, for `Cloudflare -> Caddy -> Sortarr`, `SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS=2` is usually correct, and the default per-header behavior already maps to `x_for=2`, `x_host=1`, `x_proto=1`.

If a proxied POST still fails with a CSRF mismatch, Sortarr now logs a sanitized warning with the effective request URL plus forwarded header context so you can confirm what Flask actually received.

Security note: If SORTARR_PROXY_HOPS is enabled, make sure Sortarr is only reachable through your reverse proxy. (Do not publish the Sortarr container port directly to the internet).

---

### Secret storage options

Sortarr still supports plain `.env` secrets for backward compatibility, but you can now avoid storing raw API keys/tokens directly in `.env`.

For Docker/Linux/macOS, prefer secret files:
```
SONARR_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/sonarr_api_key
RADARR_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/radarr_api_key
TAUTULLI_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/tautulli_api_key
JELLYSTAT_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/jellystat_api_key
PLEX_TOKEN_FILE=/run/secrets/plex_token
BASIC_AUTH_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/basic_auth_pass
```

On Windows, Sortarr can resolve Credential Manager references:
```
SONARR_API_KEY=wincred:Sortarr/SONARR_API_KEY
```
This mode is enabled by default for Windows EXE builds and can be overridden with:
```
SORTARR_WINDOWS_CREDSTORE=0|1
```

Resolution order is: `*_FILE` -> Windows credential reference (`*_CRED_TARGET` / `wincred:`) -> plain env value.

---

## What Sortarr does NOT do

Sortarr will never:

* Modify or rename media files
* Delete media
* Change Sonarr or Radarr configuration
* Trigger downloads automatically

All operations are read-only and safe.

---

## Security and safety

Sortarr is strictly read-only. It does not modify media files or change Sonarr/Radarr configuration.

## Supporting the project

Enjoying the project? Looking for a way to contribute?

The best way to support Sortarr is simply to use it. If you encounter bugs or issues, please report them. Feature requests and suggestions are also very welcome.

Sortarr is a free project and I will never require donations to support or maintain it.

That said, if you would like to support me directly, in the interest of transparency I should mention that any donations will most likely be spent on beer and beer-related activities. If you're still willing to contribute, I appreciate it greatly.
